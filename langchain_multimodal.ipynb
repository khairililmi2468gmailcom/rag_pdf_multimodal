It is associated with HLA-B27 and can be accompanied by psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and reactive arthritis. The clinical diagnosis depends on history, physical examination, and radiographic examination. AS typically affects young individuals below 40 years of age, with a male-to-female ratio of 5:1, and has a prevalence rate of 0.2-0.5% in Taiwan and China. Common clinical manifestations include low back pain, stiffness, limited spinal mobility, symmetric sacroiliitis, and extra-articular manifestations such as anterior uveitis, heart involvement, pulmonary fibrosis, and asymptomatic colitis.',\n",

Laboratory tests include CBC, ESR, CRP, IgA level, and HLA-B27. Radiography shows KUB grading for sacroiliitis, \"shiny corner\" sign, bridging marginal syndesmophyte, bamboo spine, osteoporosis, and ossification of interspinous ligaments. Enthesitis occurs at tendon insertions. Differential diagnosis includes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperosteosis (DISH) and osteitis condensans ilii.',\n",

Typically occurs during middle age, with women rarely having attacks before menopause. Hyperuricemia has been associated with hyper-triglyceridemia, DM, and coronary artery disease. Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism, and its levels above 8mg/dL can lead to precipitation in tissues. Gout is caused by under-excretion or over-production of uric acid, with 90% of cases caused by under-excretion. Initial gout attacks are usually monoarthritis, often affecting the lower extremity, particularly the great toe.',\n",

Prophylactic antihyperuricemic therapy is indicated for patients with recurrent attacks, chronic gout, tophi, or nephrolithiasis. Tophi are nodular masses of monosodium urate crystals deposited in soft tissues, often causing pain, damage, and deformity. Renal manifestations include nephrolithiasis, acute gouty nephropathy, and chronic urate nephropathy, which can cause proteinuria, inability to concentrate urine, and rare gout attacks despite hyperuricemia.',\n",

Lab tests include serum uric acid level and CRP, while radiography is nonspecific but may help with differential diagnosis. Treatment aims are to terminate acute attacks, prevent recurrence, prevent/reverse complications, and address associated conditions like obesity and hypertension. Non-pharmacological therapy includes dietary and lifestyle changes, while medication is required for symptomatic hyperuricemia.',\n",

For polyarticular attacks, intravenous steroids may be used. Hydroxyapatite deposits can cause acute synovitis and tendinitis, as well as chronic destructive arthropathy, and are typically diagnosed by identifying crystals in the synovial fluid or tissues using electron microscopy or alizarin red S staining.']"

      "🔍 Question: Explain the diagnosis flow for rheumatic patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 Answer:\n",
      "  The diagnosis flow for rheumatic patients typically involves a series of steps to determine the underlying cause of their joint pain or other symptoms associated with rheumatic diseases. Here is an overview of the process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initial assessment: During the initial assessment, the patient's history and physical examination are performed to identify any potential red flags that may require immediate attention or further investigation. This includes assessing for infection, malignancy, or other serious conditions that could be causing the joint pain or other symptoms.\n",
      "2. Differential diagnosis: Based on the initial assessment, a differential diagnosis is developed, which involves identifying potential causes of the patient's symptoms. This may involve considering various rheumatic diseases, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthropathy, spondyloarthropathy, lupus, and others.\n",
      "3. Laboratory testing: Laboratory tests are ordered to support or rule out the suspected diagnoses. This may include blood tests, joint aspiration, imaging studies, and other diagnostic procedures. The results of these tests are used to further narrow down the potential causes of the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "4. Diagnosis confirmation: Once a list of possible diagnoses has been developed based on the laboratory test results, the diagnosis is confirmed through additional testing or clinical evaluation. This may involve performing a joint biopsy, imaging studies, or other diagnostic procedures to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "5. Treatment plan: Once the diagnosis is confirmed, a treatment plan is developed based on the specific needs of the patient. This may involve prescribing medications, recommending physical therapy, or providing lifestyle modifications to help manage the patient's symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n",
      "6. Monitoring and follow-up: After the initial treatment plan has been implemented, the patient's response to treatment is monitored, and any necessary adjustments are made to ensure optimal outcomes. This may involve regular follow-up appointments to assess disease activity, monitor medication side effects, and make any necessary changes to the treatment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout this process, it is important for healthcare providers to maintain open communication with their patients, provide education on the diagnosis and treatment plan, and address any concerns or questions that may arise during the diagnostic and therapeutic process. \n"
