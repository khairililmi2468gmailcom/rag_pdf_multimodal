    "The clinical approach to rheumatic patients involves recognizing \"Red Flag\" symptoms and signs, such as infection, acute crystal-induced arthritis, systemic vasculitis, acute myelopathy, and fracture. The initial approach includes thorough history taking and physical examination to determine whether the musculoskeletal complaint is articular or non-articular, inflammatory or non-inflammatory, acute or chronic, and localized or widespread.",
    "Low back pain affects 26 million people, followed by osteoarthritis (17 million), fibromyalgia (3.7 million), and rheumatoid arthritis (2.1 million). Other prevalent conditions include gout, carpal tunnel syndrome, and psoriatic arthritis. Factors that contribute to the development of these conditions include age, gender, history of infection, past systemic diseases, family history, and other important factors such as smoking and alcohol intake. The onset and evolution of these conditions can be abrupt, indolent, acute, chronic, or migratory, with various causes including infectious, crystal-induced, reactive, non-inflammatory, and immune-related arthritis.",
    "A thorough physical examination is crucial for differential diagnosis in rheumatic diseases. The examination includes general inspection, neurological evaluation, musculoskeletal assessment, and other maneuvers to identify abnormalities. Key findings include skin lesions, joint deformity, swelling, tenderness, warmth, crepitus, bursal effusion, and limitation of motion.",
    "Arthritis is classified into acute or chronic, adult or juvenile, monoarthritis, oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, inflammatory or non-inflammatory, and symmetric or asymmetric polyarthritis. Articular and non-articular problems must be distinguished, as well as between inflammatory and non-inflammatory arthritis. Inflammatory disorders include infection, crystal-induced, immune-related, reactive, and idiopathic causes, while non-inflammatory disorders include trauma, ineffective repair, cellular overgrowth, and pain amplification.",
    "The table distinguishes between monoarthritis, oligoarthritis, and polyarthritis. Monoarthritis refers to inflammation in one joint, while oligoarthritis involves two to four joints, and polyarthritis affects five or more joints. The causes of monoarthritis include non-inflammatory conditions such as bursitis and tendinitis, as well as inflammatory conditions like gout and septic arthritis.",

Musculoskeletal and cutaneous manifestations also occur, including arthritis, tenosynovitis, myopathy, osteonecrosis, and skin lesions.",
    "Lupus patients may experience photosensitive skin lesions, arthritis, fatigue, hair loss, vasculitis, and kidney damage. Skin lesions can be annular or papulosquamous, with hypopigmentation but no scar. Renal manifestations include proteinuria, hematuria, and cylindruria, with diffuse proliferative nephritis potentially leading to renal failure if untreated.",
    "Nervous System involvement in SLE: Nervous system can be involved, often single or multiple lesions; depression and anxiety relate to chronic illness rather than active SLE. Laboratory diagnosis is difficult, but abnormal EEG and increased protein levels in CSF are common. CT scan is less helpful for diffuse manifestations, while MRI is the most sensitive radiographic technique. Neurologic problems often improve with immunosuppressive therapy and/or time, but recurrences occur in approximately one-third of patients.",
    "Cardiac involvement in lupus patients typically presents as pericarditis, which can lead to tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. Myocarditis can cause arrhythmias, sudden death, and heart failure. Valvular heart disease is rare but may be a source of cerebral emboli. Coronary artery disease is a significant cause of mortality in long-standing lupus patients. Arrhythmias and conduction disturbances are common and may resolve with steroid therapy or require pacemaker implantation. Pulmonary involvement includes pleuritis, pleural effusions, lupus pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary hypertension, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.",
    "Nausea, diarrhea, and vague discomfort are common gastrointestinal symptoms in SLE. Lupus peritonitis can cause abdominal pain, while intestinal vasculitis can lead to ischemic bowel disease and perforation. Steroid therapy is useful for these GI syndromes. Elevated amylase levels may indicate pancreatitis or salivary gland inflammation.",
    "Lupus-like symptoms occur in 10-30% of ANA-positive individuals. Treatment includes withdrawing the offending drug, glucocorticoids for severe cases, and antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine) for skin lesions. Mild disease may be managed with NSAIDs or low-dose steroids, while severely disabling manifestations require high doses of steroids and hydroxychloroquine.",
    "Steroid pulse therapy may rapidly control disease flares in lupus nephritis and severe CNS involvement. Immunosuppressive drugs like cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, and azathioprine are used to reduce steroid requirements and control active disease. Cytotoxic drugs have significant side effects including bone marrow suppression, infections, and increased risk of malignancy.",
    "The text discusses the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Cyclosporin A may be beneficial in managing non-renal manifestations, while plasma exchange is effective in treating thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Sex hormones like DHEA and danazol may be effective in mild to moderate disease activity and thrombocytopenia respectively. Immunizations with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are recommended to prevent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also recommended for SLE patients undergoing nonsterile surgery. The prognosis of SLE is generally poor, with increased mortality rates at 5-10 years due to infections, renal failure, thromboembolic events, and early coronary artery disease.",
    "Pregnancy in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) may lead to exacerbation, but most pregnancies are uneventful. Steroids and hydroxychloroquine can be used safely during pregnancy, while dexamethasone and betamethasone should not. Cyclophosphamide and methotrexate should ideally be stopped before pregnancy. Fertility is normal in women with SLE, but fetal loss rates are higher due to increased lupus activity and other factors.",
    "Limited scleroderma is a subset that affects the face and limbs distal to knees or elbows, while diffuse scleroderma involves the trunk or limbs proximal to knees or elbows. Key clinical manifestations include Raynaud's phenomenon, skin lesions, gastrointestinal issues, pulmonary involvement, renal involvement, cardiac involvement, and arthritis.",
    "Treatment for diffuse systemic sclerosis includes D-penicillamine 750mg daily, Nifedipine 30-120mg/day, intravenous carboprostacycline (Iloprost), and local treatment for ulcers. ACEI is the drug of choice for scleroderma renal crisis. NSAID and steroid are used to treat pericarditis and myocarditis.",
    "Adult polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) occurs in individuals aged 45-60, with a female-to-male ratio of 2:1. Clinical features include insidious proximal muscle weakness, muscle pain and tenderness, rare acute onset with rhabdomyolysis, cardiopulmonary involvement, Raynaud's phenomenon, interstitial lung disease, and symmetrical peripheral arthritis. Skin manifestations include heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules, \"Machinist's hands,\" and \"Shawl sign.\"",
    "Juvenile polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyelitis (DM) typically present in early childhood with vasculitis, myocarditis, and muscle weakness. In adults, PM/DM can also occur with soft tissue calcinosis and features similar to adult DM/PM. Myositis can also be associated with connective tissue diseases or malignancy, particularly after age 50. Laboratory tests show increased muscle enzymes, abnormal electromyography (EMG), and inflammatory cell infiltrate on biopsy. Treatment typically involves prednisolone, with methylprednisolone for severe cases, and may include cytotoxic agents in combination with steroids.",
    "The classification criteria for Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome include 6 items: ocular symptoms, oral symptoms, ocular signs, histopathologic features, salivary gland involvement, and autoantibodies. To diagnose probable primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, at least three of the six items must be met, while to establish a definitive diagnosis, four of the six items (excluding serologic parameters) or presence of anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies must be present.",
    "Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome affects primarily females during the fourth and fifth decades of life, characterized by exocrinopathy, including dry eyes and mouth, as well as extraglandular disease, such as constitutional symptoms, nonerosive polyarthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, skin lesions, and GI tract involvement.",
    "Pulmonary involvement includes dry cough, interstitial lung disease, and airway obstruction. Kidney involvement includes renal tubular acidosis, membranous glomerulopathy, and hyposthenuria. Nervous system involvement is characterized by neuropathy due to small-vessel vasculitis.",
    "Treatment options include artificial tear drops for dry eyes, sugar-free lozenges for xerostomia, pilocarpine hydrochloride for salivary stimulation, systemic steroids for severe extraglandular diseases, and hydroxychloroquine for arthralgia and myalgia. Overlap syndromes are characterized by the combination of features from multiple rheumatic diseases, with common manifestations including Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, sclerodactyly, polymyositis, and fibrosing alveolitis.",
    "Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) is an overlap syndrome combining features of SLE, scleroderma, and polymyositis, characterized by high titers of anti-U1 RNP antibodies. Diagnostic criteria include one or more common symptoms, positive anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibody, and findings in two or three disease categories (A-C). Clinical features include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, pulmonary hypertension, myositis, and fibrosing alveolitis, with potential involvement of skin, lung, heart, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, and kidneys. Prognosis is worse than lupus due to pulmonary hypertension.",
    "Cardiac echo may be important to detect early pulmonary hypertension in MCTD patients. Pulmonary function tests and DLCO should be performed at presentation and subsequent intervals to assess lung involvement progression. Other common tests include CBC, Coombs' test, ESR, serum immunoglobulins, rheumatoid factors, and anti-Sm and anti-dsDNA antibodies. There is no single laboratory test for monitoring disease activity, but a full survey of autoantibodies should be performed at intervals. Treatment depends on clinical involvement pattern, with mild cases requiring symptomatic treatment only and severe complications needing high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.",
    "Vasculitis is classified by vessel size and type, histopathologic features, ANCA presence, clinical features, or etiological basis. Primary vasculitis includes PAN, WG, MP, CSS, and cryoglobulinemia, while large-vessel vasculitis includes giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis affects the skin, and secondary vasculitis is associated with infections, connective tissue diseases, and other conditions. Demographic associations include age, male-to-female ratio, ethnicity, and type of vasculitis.",
    "Primary systemic vasculitis can be mimicked by various conditions, including other connective tissue disorders, systemic infections, malignancy, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, embolic disease, and others. Wegener's granulomatosis is a form of ANCA-associated small-vessel vasculitis characterized by necrotizing granulomatous lesions in the respiratory tract, pulmonary involvement, pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, and other manifestations such as ocular inflammation, skin lesions, peripheral neuropathy, polyarthritis, abdominal visceral involvement, and others.",
    "Treatment for aggressive Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome includes induction of remission with prednisolone and/or cyclophosphamide. Relapses are common, often treated similarly to the initial regimen, but may also be associated with respiratory tract infections. Polyarteritis nodosa is distinguished from microscopic polyangiitis by its medium-sized vessel involvement, whereas microscopic polyangiitis involves small vessels. Clinical features of both conditions include constitutional symptoms, skin involvement, myalgia, arthralgia, and nerve system involvement, as well as renal involvement in some cases.",
    "MPA is characterized by necrotizing and sometimes rapidly progressive glomerulo-nephritis, with proteinuria common and rare nephrotic syndrome possible.",
    "Treatment and prognosis are based on extent and rate of involvement; patients with limited disease receive prednisolone, while those with extensive disease receive high-dose prednisolone and may require cytotoxic agents. Minimize vascular comorbidity by controlling hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Patients poorly responding to steroids may have glucocorticoid-resistant vasculitis, superimposed infection, or progression of occlusive vasculopathy. Churg-Strauss syndrome has three phases: past history of asthma, eosinophilic infiltration, and vasculitic phase; it is characterized by ANCA positivity and can cause coronary arteritis and myocarditis, which are the principal causes of morbidity and mortality.",
    "Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP) is a systemic vasculitis in children with a peak incidence at five years old.

    "Skin manifestations vary from transient urticaria-like lesions to necrosis, with palpable purpura and urticaria-like lesions being most common. Systemic involvement occurs depending on underlying disease, with arthritis, glomerulonephritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and colic being common manifestations. Urticarial vasculitis is differentiated from chronic urticaria, while vasculitis associated with paraproteinemia is characterized by cryoglobulinemia and hyperglobulinemic purpura.",
    "The acute variant of vasculitis is often self-limited, while prognosis depends on organ systems involved and severity. Treat underlying disease; patients without cause require therapy with steroid, colchicine, or NSAID. Severe systemic necrotizing vasculitis requires rapid and aggressive treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.",

    "Beh\u00e7et's Disease is a subset of vasculitis characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, potentially affecting multiple organ systems. It shares similarities with spondyloarthropathy and inflammatory bowel disease, and is associated with HLA-B51. The pathogenesis involves immune complex-mediated vasculitis, emigration of T cells and plasma cells from dermal vessels to epidermis, and venous occlusion caused by vasculitis with thrombus formation.",
    "Episodic clinical manifestations of Beh\u00e7et's disease include mucosal ulcers, eye lesions (uveitis, hypopyon), cutaneous lesions (papules and pustules, erythema nodosum), arthritis, CNS involvement (aseptic meningitis, stroke), vessel involvement (phlebitis, pseudoaneurysm), pulmonary involvement (arterio-bronchial fistula, embolism), GI lesions, nephritis, and secondary amyloidosis.",
    "The diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et's disease relies on laboratory tests excluding other rheumatic diseases. Laboratory tests include acute phase reactants, skin biopsy for erythema nodosum, angiography or venous scan for vessel thrombosis, and HLA-ABC to detect HLA-B51 presence. CNS involvement is detected by brain SPECT scan, cerebral angiography, or CSF examination showing increased cell count with PMN dominance in acute stage and lymphocyte dominance later. Treatment includes topical corticosteroid for oral ulcers, prednisolone for mild systemic manifestations, colchicine to reduce severity of oral and eye lesions, cytotoxic agents for intractable manifestations, anti-coagulant and low-dose aspirin for vessel occlusion, plasma exchange for resistant CNS involvement, thalidomide for resistant ulceration, and chlorambucil with caution due to toxic side effects.",
    "Immunodeficiency diseases are characterized by disruptions to immune integrity, classified into T cell, B cell, macrophage/neutrophil, and complement deficiencies. Primary immunodeficiencies are usually inherited and can be categorized as T cell or antibody deficiencies, while secondary immunodeficiencies result from infections, malnutrition, malignancies, and other causes.",
    "Infants with primary immunoglobulin defects typically present with serious infections at 3-6 months old, while those with cellular or phagocytic immunodeficiencies may present earlier. Common variable immunodeficiency usually presents in the second decade of life. Immunization history and family history are crucial in evaluating suspected immunodeficiency, with prolonged infection course, recurrent infections, unusual severe infections, opportunistic organisms, and disseminated neisserial infections being suspicious indicators.",
    "Laboratory tests for investigating immunity integrity include complete blood count and differential to evaluate neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and platelets. Tests also assess cellular immunodeficiency through chest radiographs, skin tests, T cell functional assays, and HIV testing; humoral immunity through serum immunoglobulin measurements, isohemagglutinin titers, vaccination responses, and IgG subclass measurement; phagocytic disorders through neutrophil count, chemotaxis, and oxidative burst assay; and complement deficiency through CH50 and APH50 assays.",

It is associated with HLA-B27 and can be accompanied by psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and reactive arthritis. The clinical diagnosis depends on history, physical examination, and radiographic examination. AS typically affects young individuals below 40 years of age, with a male-to-female ratio of 5:1, and has a prevalence rate of 0.2-0.5% in Taiwan and China. Common clinical manifestations include low back pain, stiffness, limited spinal mobility, symmetric sacroiliitis, and extra-articular manifestations such as anterior uveitis, heart involvement, pulmonary fibrosis, and asymptomatic colitis.",
    "Physical examination for sacroiliitis includes direct compression, lateral compression, Ganslen's sign, and Patrick test. Schober's test measures lumbar spine mobility. Laboratory tests include CBC, ESR, CRP, IgA level, and HLA-B27. Radiography shows KUB grading for sacroiliitis, \"shiny corner\" sign, bridging marginal syndesmophyte, bamboo spine, osteoporosis, and ossification of interspinous ligaments. Enthesitis occurs at tendon insertions. Differential diagnosis includes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperosteosis (DISH) and osteitis condensans ilii.",
    "Treatment for Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) includes NSAIDs for symptom relief, DMARDs like sulfasalazine and methotrexate which may have disease-modifying effects, immunosuppressives for peripheral joint synovitis, anti-TNF therapy, steroids for severe symptoms, biologics, physiotherapy to manage symptoms and prevent disability, and treatment for uveitis with topical corticosteroid eye drops and mydriatics.",
    "Psoriatic arthropathy is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs in 7-42% of patients with psoriasis, often preceding or coinciding with skin lesions. It can present as asymmetric oligoarthritis, destructive arthritis, spondylitis, and extra-articular manifestations such as ocular and cardiac lesions, nail changes, and skin lesions. Laboratory tests may show elevated ESR and CRP, while HLA-B27 presence may be helpful in diagnosis.",

Biological agents like anti-TNFa therapy are effective for ankylosing spondylitis.",
    "The prevalence of gout is equal in men and women, but men are six times more likely to have hyperuricemia. Typically occurs during middle age, with women rarely having attacks before menopause. Hyperuricemia has been associated with hyper-triglyceridemia, DM, and coronary artery disease. Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism, and its levels above 8mg/dL can lead to precipitation in tissues. Gout is caused by under-excretion or over-production of uric acid, with 90% of cases caused by under-excretion. Initial gout attacks are usually monoarthritis, often affecting the lower extremity, particularly the great toe.",
    "Interval or intercritical gout occurs after an acute attack has resolved and the patient becomes asymptomatic. Prophylactic antihyperuricemic therapy is indicated for patients with recurrent attacks, chronic gout, tophi, or nephrolithiasis. Tophi are nodular masses of monosodium urate crystals deposited in soft tissues, often causing pain, damage, and deformity. Renal manifestations include nephrolithiasis, acute gouty nephropathy, and chronic urate nephropathy, which can cause proteinuria, inability to concentrate urine, and rare gout attacks despite hyperuricemia.",
    "Diagnostic evaluation of gout involves synovial fluid aspiration to reveal monosodium urate crystals, ruling out other disorders and considering co-existence with other rheumatic diseases. Lab tests include serum uric acid level and CRP, while radiography is nonspecific but may help with differential diagnosis. Treatment aims are to terminate acute attacks, prevent recurrence, prevent/reverse complications, and address associated conditions like obesity and hypertension. Non-pharmacological therapy includes dietary and lifestyle changes, while medication is required for symptomatic hyperuricemia.",
    "Three treatments for acute gouty arthritis are NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids. NSAIDs are the most favored treatment, while colchicine is used in combination with NSAIDs to prevent recurrence. Corticosteroids are used when other options are ineffective or contraindicated.",
    "A reasonable goal is to reduce serum uric acid concentration to < 6 mg/dL. Anti-hyperuricemic drugs include uricosurics and xanthine oxidase inhibitors like allopurinol and febuxostat. Uricosuric agents are used in patients with under-excretion of uric acid, while xanthine oxidase inhibitors are favored for elderly patients due to impaired renal function.",
    "A degenerative joint disease characterized by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals accumulating in articular cartilage, synovium, and periarticular tissues. Clinical features include asymptomatic or acute/subacute arthritis, pseudo-osteoarthritis, and pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis. Investigations and diagnosis involve examination of aspirated synovial fluid for CPPD crystals, checking calcium, phosphate, and magnesium levels, and radiography to detect osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis.",
    "The treatment of articular chondrocalcinosis typically involves joint aspiration to relieve pressure, anti-inflammatory medications like NSAIDs or intra-articular steroids, and prophylactic treatment with colchicine. For polyarticular attacks, intravenous steroids may be used. Hydroxyapatite deposits can cause acute synovitis and tendinitis, as well as chronic destructive arthropathy, and are typically diagnosed by identifying crystals in the synovial fluid or tissues using electron microscopy or alizarin red S staining."
